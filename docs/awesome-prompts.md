## Advanced Features

### Caching and Performance

The AwesomePrompts manager includes several performance optimizations:

```python
# LRU caching for frequent access
prompt_manager = AwesomePrompts(cache_size=256)

# Thread-safe operations
import threading
def safe_access():
    with threading.Lock():
        prompt = prompt_manager.get_act("Developer")
        print(prompt)

# Efficient updates with minimal network calls
prompt_manager.update_prompts_from_online()
```

### Custom Repository Integration

```python
# Use a custom prompts repository
custom_manager = AwesomePrompts(
    repo_url="https://your-company.com/custom-prompts.json",
    local_path="/company/prompts/custom.json"
)

# Update from custom source
custom_manager.update_prompts_from_online(force=True)
```

### Error Handling and Validation

```python
# Comprehensive error handling
try:
    prompt = prompt_manager.get_act("NonExistentPrompt")
    if prompt is None:
        print("Prompt not found, using default")
        prompt = "Default prompt text"
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error getting prompt: {e}")

# Input validation when adding prompts
success = prompt_manager.add_prompt(
    "Valid Prompt Name",
    "This is a valid prompt text that meets all requirements."
)
```

### Batch Operations

```python
# Process multiple prompts efficiently
prompts_to_use = ["Developer", "Tech Writer", "UX/UI Developer"]
for prompt_name in prompts_to_use:
    prompt = prompt_manager.get_act(prompt_name)
    if prompt:
        process_prompt(prompt)

# Filter and display specific categories
prompt_manager.show_acts(search="developer")
```

## Integration Guide

### With Webscout Providers

```python
from webscout.Provider import ChatGPT, ClaudeOnline

claude = ClaudeOnline()

# Use prompts with different providers
def ask_with_prompt(provider, prompt_name, question):
    """Ask a question using a specific prompt persona."""
    persona_prompt = prompt_manager.get_act(prompt_name)
    if persona_prompt:
        full_prompt = f"{persona_prompt}\n\nQuestion: {question}"
        return provider.ask(full_prompt)
    return None

# Example usage
response = ask_with_prompt(chatgpt, "Tech Writer", "Explain quantum computing")
print(response)
```

### With FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from webscout.prompt_manager import AwesomePrompts

app = FastAPI()
prompt_manager = AwesomePrompts()

@app.get("/prompts/{prompt_name}")
async def get_prompt(prompt_name: str):
    """Get a specific prompt by name."""
    prompt = prompt_manager.get_act(prompt_name)
    if prompt is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Prompt not found")
    return {"prompt_name": prompt_name, "prompt_text": prompt}

@app.get("/prompts/")
async def list_prompts(search: str = None, limit: int = 50):
    """List available prompts with optional filtering."""
    prompt_manager.show_acts(search=search, limit=limit)
    return {"message": "Prompts displayed in console"}
```

### With CLI Applications

    if prompt:
        click.echo(prompt)
    else:
        click.echo(f"Prompt '{prompt_name}' not found", err=True)

@cli.command()
@click.option('--search', '-s', help='Search term')
@click.option('--limit', '-l', default=20, help='Limit results')
def list(search, limit):
    """List available prompts"""
    prompt_manager = AwesomePrompts()
    prompt_manager.show_acts(search=search, limit=limit)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    cli()
```

### With Testing Frameworks

```python
import pytest
from webscout.prompt_manager import AwesomePrompts

@pytest.fixture
def prompt_manager():
    """Fixture for prompt manager"""
    return AwesomePrompts(auto_update=False)

def test_get_existing_prompt(prompt_manager):

    assert prompt is None

def test_add_and_delete_prompt(prompt_manager):
    """Test adding and deleting a prompt"""
    # Add a test prompt
    success = prompt_manager.add_prompt("TestPrompt", "Test prompt content")
    assert success is True
    
    # Verify it exists
    prompt = prompt_manager.get_act("TestPrompt")
    assert prompt == "Test prompt content"
    
    # Delete it
    success = prompt_manager.delete_prompt("TestPrompt")
    assert success is True
    
    # Verify it's gone
    prompt = prompt_manager.get_act("TestPrompt")
    assert prompt is None
```

### With Async Applications

```python
import asyncio
from webscout.prompt_manager import AwesomePrompts

async def process_prompts_async():
    """Example of using prompts in async context"""
    prompt_manager = AwesomePrompts()
    
    # Get multiple prompts
    prompts = []
    for name in ["Developer", "Tech Writer", "UX/UI Developer"]:
        prompt = prompt_manager.get_act(name)
        if prompt:
            prompts.append((name, prompt))
    
    # Process them asynchronously
    async def process_prompt_pair(name, prompt):
        # Simulate async processing
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        return f"Processed {name}: {len(prompt)} chars"
    
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        process_prompt_pair(name, prompt) 
        for name, prompt in prompts
    ])
    
    return results

# Run the async function
results = asyncio.run(process_prompts_async())
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

## Usage Tips

> [!TIP]
> - **Activation**: Use `prompt_manager.get_act("PromptName")` to retrieve specific prompts
> - **Caching**: Enable caching for better performance with frequently accessed prompts
> - **Updates**: Use `auto_update=True` to keep prompts current with the online repository
> - **Customization**: Add your own prompts with `add_prompt()` for specialized use cases
> - **Thread Safety**: The manager is thread-safe for concurrent access in multi-threaded applications
> - **Error Handling**: Always check for `None` returns when prompts might not exist

## Configuration Best Practices

```python
# Production configuration
production_manager = AwesomePrompts(
    repo_url="https://your-company.com/production-prompts.json",
    local_path="/var/lib/webscout/prompts.json",
    auto_update=True,
    cache_size=512,
    timeout=30,
    max_workers=8
)

# Development configuration
development_manager = AwesomePrompts(
    repo_url="https://localhost:8000/dev-prompts.json",
    local_path="./dev-prompts.json",
    auto_update=False,
    cache_size=128,
    timeout=10
)

# Testing configuration
test_manager = AwesomePrompts(
    repo_url="https://test-repo.com/prompts.json",
    local_path="./test-prompts.json",
    auto_update=False,
    cache_size=64
)
```
